# marcel
Dynamic theme library for the iced GUI framework

---

`marcel` introduces a new way to load and manage themes for the [`iced`](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) GUI framework,
allowing the users to distribute and develop their own themes.

This crate integrates seamlessly with both `iced` in the GUI front and [`serde`](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde) in the Serialization front,
while being agnostic to the serialization format chosen by the user.

## Usage
Add this to you `Cargo.toml`
```
[dependencies]
marcel = "0.1"
```
